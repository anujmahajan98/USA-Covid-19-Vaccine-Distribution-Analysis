Covid 19 Vaccine distribution analysis in USA for Sept 2022 - Sept 2023

In this project I analyzed the Covid 19 Vaccine distribution in USA for the period Sept 2022 - Sept 2023. For this project I have used the data published by US Government for Covid â€“ 19 Vaccine distribution for the last 1 year. The data is available at [covid - 19 vaccine distribution data](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc). This data consist of different attributes like total number of vaccines distributed, number of vaccines administered, Number of vaccines distributed for people having age > 18, age > 50 and age > 65. Through this data, we can analyze what are the current trends going on in covid-19 vaccine distribution in each US State and hence can analyze the spread of covid-19 as well.
The following concepts of the big data from the course are used throughout the project.

 - Data Ingestion and Storage
 - Virtualization
 - Cloud Computing
 - Data Lifecycle & Pipelines
 - Data Processing and Analytics
 - AI Fairness
   
During this project, I downloaded the data from CDC website and kept it in the MongoDB Atlas which acted as a storage service for the project. Then I read all the data through python inbuilt libraries. I incorporated Jetstream VM to run my python code on the data. After that, I set up the data pipeline where I transformed the data and performed the in-depth analysis and at the end published the data and code on cloud (GCP) and GitHub.

Below is the data pipeline followed to achieve the end result

For the detailed analysis you can look up the report shared in this git repository. Along with that I have published some of the interesting analysis on MongoDB chart Dashboard. The dashboard is public and you can access it on the following link.
